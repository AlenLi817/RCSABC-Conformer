Paper: [*Residual cosine similar attention and bidirectional convolution in dual-branch network for skin lesion image classification*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095219762400544X)  

This method is implemented in the mmclassification of Open-mmLab,  
mmcv-full==1.5.1,mmcls==0.22.1.  

Currently, mmclassification is updated to mmpretrain: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpretrain 
  
After completing the tutorial, you only need to add the RCSABC-conformer.py in the following path and configure it correctly:  
mmpretrain/models/backbones
